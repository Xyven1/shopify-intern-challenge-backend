# Shopify Intern Challenge Backend

This is my code for the spotify backend challenge. I wrote my web app in Go, using most significantly sqlite3 for a integrated database and gorilla/mux for http routing.

# Features
- Basic CRUD functionality
- Centralized error handling
- Complete history system, including fully featured undo functionality
